$2^{15} = 32768$ and the sum of its digits is $3 + 2 + 7 + 6 + 8 = 26$.

What is the sum of the digits of the number $2^{1000}$?

# Notes

## Finding the Nth trailing digit (last digits) 

This involves modular arithmetic. To find the last digit, you can compute $b^{n}\quad (\bmod 10))$. To find the last two digits, compute $b^{n}\quad (\bmod 100)$, and so on. 

Example: To find the last digit of $7^{358}$:

1. Observe the pattern of the last digits of powers of the base: The last digits of powers of $7$ follow the pattern $7, 9, 3, 1, 7, 9, 3, 1,...$ This pattern has a length of $4$.

2. Divide the exponent by the pattern length and find the remainder: $358\div 4=89$ with a remainder of $2$.

3. Use the remainder to find the corresponding digit in the pattern: A remainder of $2$ means the second digit in the pattern (which is $9$) is the last digit of $7^{358}$. 

## Finding the Nth leading digit (first digits) 

This is more complex and typically requires logarithms. 

Determine the number of digits in $b^{n}$ using logarithms: This can be done with the formula $d=1+\lfloor n\cdot \log _{10}b\rfloor$, where $d$ is the number of digits.

Manipulate the power using logarithms to isolate the desired digit: For instance, if you want the first digit, you need to find the value $t$ such that $10^{d-k}\cdot t<b^{n}<10^{d-k}\cdot (t+1)$, where $k$ is the position of the leading digit you want.  This can be rewritten using logarithms and involve finding the fractional part of $n\cdot \log _{10}b$ to reveal the leading digits, according to this Math Stack Exchange answer. 

## Important considerations 

Large numbers: When dealing with very large powers, direct calculation is often computationally expensive and impractical due to the size of the result.Computational tools: Logarithms and modular arithmetic are essential for efficiently finding the Nth digit of powers without calculating the entire number.
